## Inspector Settings

Each interactable object now has these glow settings:

- **Glow Intensity**: Brightness of the glow (1.5-2.0 recommended)
- **Glow Pulse Speed**: Speed of pulsing animation (2.0-3.0 recommended)
- **Enable Pulse**: Toggle pulsing animation on/off

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Glow Materials
For each object type, create a material using the "Custom/SpriteGlow" shader:

**Sign Material:**
- Glow Color: Yellow/White
- Glow Intensity: 1.5-2.0

**Chest Material:**
- Glow Color: Yellow/Gold
- Glow Intensity: 1.5-2.0

**Door Material:**
- Glow Color: Cyan/Blue  
- Glow Intensity: 1.5-2.0

### 2. Configure Each Object
1. Select your Sign/Chest/Door GameObject
2. In the respective Controller component:
   - Check "Use Advanced Glow"
   - Set appropriate Glow Intensity (1.5-2.0)
   - Set Glow Pulse Speed (2.0-3.0)
   - Check "Enable Pulse" for animated effect

### 3. Test the Effects
- Run the game and approach each interactable object
- Each should glow beautifully when you get near
- Press F to interact as normal

## Color Schemes

**Default Colors:**
- ðŸª§ **Sign**: Yellow glow (attention-grabbing)
- ðŸ“¦ **Chest**: Yellow/Gold glow (treasure-like)  
- ðŸšª **Door**: Cyan glow (cool, mysterious)

**Customization:**
You can change the glow colors in each controller's "Highlight Color" setting to match your game's aesthetic.

## Performance Notes

- âœ… Efficient material switching system
- âœ… Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
- âœ… No impact on performance when objects aren't being highlighted

## Features

- **Door**: Only glows when closed, stops when opened  
- **Sign**: Always available for interaction

### Proximity Detection
- Automatic detection through character controller
- Smooth enter/exit range transitions
- No manual setup required

### Visual Effects
- Smooth pulsing animation
- Customizable intensity and speed
- Professional shader-based rendering

## Next Steps

Your glow system is now fully functional! Try approaching each object type to see the beautiful glow effects. You can customize the colors and intensities to match your game's visual style.

The system is designed to work seamlessly with your existing dialogue and interaction systems - everything should work exactly as before, but with much more attractive visual feedback.
