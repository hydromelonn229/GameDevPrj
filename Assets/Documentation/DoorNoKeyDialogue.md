# ðŸšª Door No-Key Dialogue Feature Added

## Overview
Added a new dialogue system for when players try to open a door but don't have the required key yet. This provides better feedback and guidance to players.

## What's New

### New Dialogue Setting
- **No Key Dialogue**: A customizable message shown when player presses F on a locked door without having the key
- Default message: *"The door is locked tight. You need to find a key to open it."*

### Updated Interaction Logic
- **Before**: F key only worked when player had a key
- **Now**: F key always responds, showing appropriate feedback

### Interaction Flow
1. **Player approaches door** â†’ First approach dialogue (if enabled)
2. **Player presses F without key** â†’ No key dialogue 
3. **Player presses F with key** â†’ Door opens + door open dialogue

## Inspector Settings

In the **DoorController** component, you'll now see:

### Dialogue Settings
- âœ… **Enable Dialogue**: Toggle dialogue system
- âœ… **First Approach Dialogue**: Message when first approaching door
- âœ… **No Key Dialogue**: Message when trying to open without key (NEW!)
- âœ… **Door Open Dialogue**: Message when successfully opening door
- âœ… **Dialogue Manager**: Reference to dialogue system

## Default Messages

### First Approach
*"This door seems to be locked. You might need a key to open it."*

### No Key (NEW!)
*"The door is locked tight. You need to find a key to open it."*

### Door Opened
*"The key works! The door creaks open, revealing what lies beyond..."*

## Customization

You can customize the no-key dialogue message in the inspector or via script:

```csharp
// Set all three dialogue messages
doorController.SetDialogueMessages(
    "A mysterious door blocks your path...", 
    "This door requires an ancient key!", 
    "The ancient door opens with a heavy creak..."
);

// Or just set approach and open messages (backwards compatible)
doorController.SetDialogueMessages(
    "A locked door stands before you.", 
    "Success! The door is now open."
);
```

## Features

### Smart Feedback
- âœ… Always responds when player presses F
- âœ… Different messages based on whether player has key
- âœ… Helps guide players to find the key first
- âœ… Maintains existing glow and interaction systems

### User Experience
- âœ… No more "dead" F key presses on locked doors
- âœ… Clear feedback about what player needs to do
- âœ… Consistent with other dialogue systems in your game
- âœ… Customizable messages for different door types

## Testing

1. **Approach a door without a key** â†’ See first approach dialogue
2. **Press F without a key** â†’ See "door is locked" message
3. **Get a key and press F** â†’ Door opens with success message

This creates a much better user experience where players always get feedback when trying to interact with doors!
